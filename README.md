##  Overview
CrimeCast is a predictive analytics project that classifies crime incidents into categories. It demonstrates machine learning workflows from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

##  Dataset
- Dataset includes `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample.csv`.
- Available features may include date, time, location, and crime descriptors (based on your actual columns).
- The goal: Predict crime categories given input features.

---

##  Features
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multi-class classification modeling
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Model comparison for performance tuning

---

##  Modeling Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting date-time features (like hour, day, month)  
3. **Model Training**: Training algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM  
4. **Evaluation**: Using classification reports and confusion matrices to assess performance  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn (for EDA)  
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter for interactive development and analysis

**Key Observations:**
- Baseline (Dummy) model achieved **58%** accuracy.
- Non-Ensemble models (Logistic Regression, SVM) performed well (~94â€“95%).
- Ensemble models (LGBM, XGBoost, Voting) outperformed others, with **XGBoost Classifier** reaching the highest accuracy of **95.8%**.
- Class imbalance was present; SMOTE was tested but did not improve the top result.

**Final Best Model:** XGBoost Classifier â€” 95.8% Accuracy
